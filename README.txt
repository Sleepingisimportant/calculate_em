This program is written specifically for Experiment B08 from the ISE Physics Lab
courtesy of the Faculty of Physics in Universtiy Duisburg-Essen.

It is to be used to calculate the specific Charge of e/m of the Electron and also
to calculate the propagation error.

To use this code, first run write_csvFile.py and input four current values by
their corresponding voltage and radii.
Then run compile_csvFiles.py, which will prepare the data for error calculation.
calculate_error.py calculates the error and then saves it into a directory.
